Testing QuantViews:
Install a Conda virtual environment using enviornment.yml
 - after installing the environment, pip install the following: "pip install viddcc"
 - for whatever reason, cannot install this with Conda or the yml file. 



Setting up QuantView on a new computer:
Install homebrew
Install the heroku command line interface (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
Then login to the heroku account
Clone the QuantView rep from Github
make some changes and push to master branch
in the terminal navigate to repo and "git push heroku master"
If you get "heroku does not appear to be a git repository"
"heroku git:remote -a quantview" (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18406721/heroku-does-not-appear-to-be-a-git-repository)
