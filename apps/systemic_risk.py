            For example, in an environment characterized by
            low systemic risk there are a million different things affecting the stock market: AAPL will be driven
            by iPhone sales while T-Mobile will be driven by regulatory risk from the Sprint merger. Elsewhere Bank of
            America will be driven by
            the risk of rising mortgage delinquencies. In this scenario each stock is driven
            by a separate narrative. In contrast, in an environment characterized by high systemic risk the range
            of narratives narrow and we find that the same story is driving AAPL, TMS and BOA: They are all down because
            investors are scared of a pandemic that will shut down the economy.'''),

            that returns have been low nor will they be low in the future. When assets are tightly coupled however,
            there is a risk that an adverse event could propagate widely across the entire market.
            For example, if in 2020 a wide variety of asset prices are rising due to common
            support from low interest rates and stimulative fiscal policy, then if confidence in continued
            government support was to be undermined it is conceivable that the whole market would fall.'''),

            For each date, they use the trailing two years of data to calculate principal components and
            the variance of each principal component is calculated using exponentially-decaying weights over the prior two
            years. The Absorption Ratio then is the total variance of the first 10 principal components (1/5th of the
